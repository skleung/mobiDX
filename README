# Login Instructions

You can login to the below user accounts or sign up as a new user.

Existing patient account: "paul" with password "abc"
Existing physician account: "doc" with password "abc"

# General notes

* I recommend taking a few pictures, drawing on them, and then uploading several pictures with and without tags.
* After exploring the patient side of the application, login as a physician and change your tag to see appropriately fetched content
* View patients that you should be treating in the patients tab
* When signing up for an account, clicking "Done" will return you to the login screen that you should use to login with your newly created user
* If fetching from Parse hangs. I suggest checking internet connectivity or just switching tabs to try fetching again.
